        <p style="border: 5px solid yellowgreen"> Hello there! My name is Kong Peng Yang (you can call me kp)
            
            I Love playing Games, as we all do, and joined NEIT because I wanted to have the freedom to make my own game! 
            I always though about the creation of games and if I could one day making one I'm proud of. Although I do 
            love games, most of the time I spend my time helping my parents making their life a bit easier. My favorite 
            foods are as followed; Burgers, fries, fried rise (with all the meat options), ribs, pumkin and pumkin soup 
            (very tender if cooked right!), and <i style="color:rgb(255, 176, 111) "><b>potatoes!</i></b> (<u>You can never go wrong with potatoes unless you suck at cooking</u>)
